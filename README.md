# MetaMap

This repository describes the code and analyses accompanying the [Simon et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/22/269092) manuscript.

The MetaMap bioinformatic pipeline screens human RNA-seq datasets for the presence of microbial and viral reads by re-inspecting the non-human-mapping read fraction. [Simon et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/22/269092) applied the pipeline to close to 150 terabytes of publicly available raw RNA-seq data from >17,000 samples from >400 studies relevant to human disease using state-of-the-art high performance computing systems. 

Detailed information about the MetaMap pipeline can be found [here](dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.msec6be).

A tutorial describing the statistical analysis of the resulting output can be found in Example_code.Rmd.
